# TCMF Night Log

Append-only, one entry per night, newest last. Written by the nightly hardening routine
(see `NIGHT_QUEUE.md`).

Each entry must record: which queue item, why it was chosen, **what the numbers actually
said** (including when they hurt the paper), what was verified vs assumed, and the LaTeX
delta the private paper repo needs.

## 2026-07-23 (setup, not a night task)

- **Task:** Built the 14-night hardening queue (`NIGHT_QUEUE.md`) and registered the nightly
  cloud routine that works it.
- **Why:** The paper's evidence base, not its prose, is what stands between it and a
  reviewer's "this is a small handcrafted synthetic benchmark." Two weeks of one-step-per-
  night on scale, domains, baselines, ablations, uncertainty, and figures.
- **Result:** Queue N01-N14 written, ordered so the riskiest item (N01, larger candidate
  pool) runs first - it is the one that could invalidate every later night. N06 and N14 are
  flagged LOCAL-ONLY (Ollama); the cloud agent skips them and takes the next CLOUD-OK item.
- **Verified:** benchmark inventory confirmed against the real tree - `GenConfig` already
  carries `n_distractors` / `n_noise` (so N01 is a threading job, not a rewrite), `run_eval`
  and `run_mixed` currently expose only `--n/--seed/--out`, no scipy and no matplotlib are
  installed locally (hence pure-numpy stats in N02 and a `requirements-bench.txt` in N09).
- **Next:** N01.
