# CivilizationOS - Master Build Log
**Phases 0 through 10 | Complete cross-reference with original plan**

> Updated: 2026-06-23 | Version: 0.10.0 | Tests: 54 passing | TS errors: 0

## 1. Project Overview

CivilizationOS is a portfolio-grade AI project demonstrating **four required academic pillars** in a single coherent system:

| Pillar | How CivilizationOS delivers it |
|---|---|
| Multi-agent system + domain problem | 10 autonomous citizen-agents (AGORA) + 5 institutional councils × 5 specialist agents (PANTHEON) = **35 agents total** governing a simulated society |
| RAG - novel retrieval | **Temporal-Causal Memory Fusion (TCMF)** - fuses per-agent episodic memory streams with a society-wide causal event graph; not reproducible with any off-the-shelf RAG |
| Fine-tuned model + MLOps | LoRA fine-tune on Qwen2.5 3B (Unsloth, free Colab T4), MLflow run tracking, persona-consistency + debate-quality eval harness |
| Full-stack + Claude API | React + PixiJS isometric city ↔ FastAPI/WebSocket backend; Claude Haiku/Sonnet powers council debates in premium mode |

**Hard constraints from day one:** near-zero budget ($20 cap), Windows 11 laptop, local Ollama, no GPU except free Colab.

## 3. The Novel RAG - Temporal-Causal Memory Fusion (TCMF)

This is the project's primary differentiator. Standard RAG retrieves by semantic similarity alone. TCMF fuses two retrieval layers:

**Layer 1 - Episodic Memory Stream (per citizen):**
Every observation, conversation, reflection, and council decision is a timestamped memory entry with three scores:
- `relevance` = embedding cosine similarity to the query
- `recency` = exponential decay from tick of creation
- `importance` = static weight by kind (observation: 2.0 → conversation: 4.0 → reflection: 6.0 → event: 8.0 → decision: 9.0)

Retrieval score: `α·relevance + β·recency + γ·importance`

Periodic **reflection** (every 240 ticks / one in-world day) synthesises recent memories into higher-level beliefs via LLM.

**Layer 2 - Civic Causal Graph (society-wide):**
A NetworkX directed temporal graph linking `crisis → debate → council decision → resolution → downstream crisis`. Edges carry timestamp and causal weight. `auto_link_predecessors()` automatically connects new events to semantically similar prior events.

**Fusion:**
```
fused_score(memory, query) = episodic_score(memory, query) × (1 + λ × causal_boost(memory))
```
`causal_boost` rewards memories that are semantically close to the **causal ancestors** of the current query event - a witness at the root cause outranks a rumour-holder. When a council deliberates, specialists retrieve the most causally-relevant episodic + institutional precedents and argue using real history.

## 4. Cost Architecture - 3-Tier LLM Router

| Tier | Brain | Used for | Per-call cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| **0** | Ollama + Qwen2.5 3B (local) | Citizen conversations, observations, reflections, embeddings (nomic-embed-text) | **$0** |
| **1** | Gemini Flash (free API quota) | Council Historian, Strategist, Skeptic, Predictor turns | **$0** |
| **2** | Claude Haiku 4.5 / Sonnet 4.6 | Council Synthesizer VERDICT turn (premium mode only) | **~$0.002/debate** |

`PREMIUM_MODE=false` → entire app runs at $0. `PREMIUM_MODE=true` → only the final verdict turn hits Claude.  
Running spend tracked live in `/health` → shown in frontend spend counter → full demo costs ~$0.05–0.30.

---

## 5. Phase-by-Phase Build Record

---

### Phase 0 - Foundation
**Duration:** ~2 days | **Planned:** ✅ fully executed

#### What was built

**Backend:**
- `api/config.py` - Pydantic settings: `PREMIUM_MODE`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `OLLAMA_BASE_URL`, `SIM_SEED`, `TICK_SECONDS`, `TIER2_BUDGET_USD`. Loaded once with `@lru_cache`.
- `api/llm/router.py` - 3-tier `LLMRouter`:
  - `Tier.LOCAL` → Ollama chat completions
  - `Tier.FREE` → `google-generativeai` SDK (Gemini Flash)
  - `Tier.PREMIUM` → `anthropic` SDK (Claude)
  - Auto-downgrade: if `PREMIUM_MODE=false`, Tier 2 falls back to Tier 1; if Gemini quota exhausted, falls back to Tier 0
  - `router.embed(texts)` → nomic-embed-text via Ollama
  - `router.spend` → running USD spend tracker with budget assertion
- `api/main.py` - FastAPI app skeleton: `/health`, `/ws` WebSocket, CORS middleware for `localhost:5173`
- `api/__init__.py`, `api/sim/__init__.py`, `api/agents/__init__.py`, `api/memory/__init__.py`, `api/llm/__init__.py`

**Frontend:**
- React + Vite + TypeScript scaffold (`web/`)
- `web/src/ws/store.ts` - Zustand store, WebSocket connect, world state subscriber
- Basic `App.tsx` receiving WebSocket ticks and displaying raw JSON

**Tests:**
- `api/tests/test_router.py` - unit tests for all 3 tiers, fallback logic, spend tracking

#### Plan vs reality
The original plan mentioned **ChromaDB** as the vector store. In practice a lighter **in-process vectorstore** (`api/memory/vectorstore.py`) was built instead - no separate ChromaDB server, lower setup friction, zero cost. Functionally equivalent for the project's scale.

---

### Phase 1 - AGORA: Living City
**Duration:** ~1 week | **Planned:** ✅ mostly executed

#### What was built

**Backend:**

`api/sim/world.py`:
- 20×15 isometric grid
- 10 named shared locations: home cluster, Clinic, Market, City Hall, Precinct, Press Building, Park, Trade Exchange, Library, Community Centre
- `DayPhase` enum (NIGHT / MORNING / WORK / EVENING) cycling every 240 ticks
- `clock_label()` → "08:00" style display
- `phase_for_tick()` deterministic time function

`api/agents/personas.py`:
- `Persona` dataclass: `id`, `name`, `age`, `occupation`, `traits`, `sociability`, `home_id`, `workplace_id`
- `SEED_CITIZENS` - 10 fully defined personas: Ava (doctor), Ben (journalist), Cara (trader), Dan (police), Eli (teacher), Finn (lawyer), Grace (cook), Hana (nurse), Ivan (engineer), Jaya (analyst)

`api/agents/citizen.py`:
- `Citizen` wraps a `Persona`; owns `memory`, `relationships`, `fear`, `location_id`, `talk_cooldown`
- `decide_target(world, tick, closed_locations)` - location routing by day phase; routes workers to workplace during WORK phase, home during NIGHT, shared locations otherwise; reroutes around `closed_locations`
- `step()` - one-cell grid movement toward target
- `apply_fear(delta)` / `decay_fear(rate)` / `decay_relationships()`
- `adjust_relationship(other_id, delta)` - ±1 float, clamped; decays 0.5% per tick toward 0
- `snapshot()` → JSON-serialisable dict for WebSocket broadcast

`api/memory/stream.py`:
- `MemoryEntry` dataclass: `text`, `tick`, `kind`, `importance`, `embedding`
- `MemoryStream.add()` - stores by UUID
- `MemoryStream.recent(k)` - last-k by tick
- `MemoryStream.important_since(since_tick, k)` - top-k by importance in window
- `MemoryStream.retrieve(query_emb, alpha, beta, gamma, k)` - TCMF-scored retrieval

`api/memory/vectorstore.py`:
- `VectorStore.add(id, embedding, metadata)`
- `VectorStore.search(query_emb, k)` - L2 cosine, returns `(id, score, metadata)` tuples

`api/sim/engine.py` (Phase 1 core):
- `Engine.__init__` - creates `World`, `citizens`, `CausalGraph`, `TCMFRetriever`, `CrisisRegistry`
- `Engine.advance()` - single async tick: decay fear/relationships, route citizens, record arrivals, maybe spark conversations, trigger end-of-day reflections
- `_start_conversation(a, b, loc, tick)` - adjusts relationship deltas, logs event, spawns LLM task if enabled
- `_llm_converse(a, b, place, tick)` - Tier 0 LLM generates one in-character dialogue line
- `_llm_reflect(c, tick)` - end-of-day reflection prompt (Tier 0); synthesises recent memories into one honest belief sentence
- `snapshot()` → world state dict including citizens, locations, events, clock

`api/main.py` additions:
- `_sim_loop()` - `asyncio.create_task` background loop advancing one tick per `tick_interval`
- `_broadcast_debate_turn()` - pushes `debate_turn` WebSocket messages
- `GET /agent/{agent_id}` - citizen detail (memories, relationships)

**Frontend:**

`web/src/city/CityStage.tsx`:
- PixiJS Application mounted on a `<canvas>`
- Isometric projection: `(col, row) → screen (x, y)`
- Location tiles drawn with occupation-specific palettes (clinic = blue, market = amber, etc.)
- Citizen sprites as coloured circles; move smoothly between grid positions
- Name + occupation label below each citizen

`web/src/city/iso.ts`:
- `toScreen(col, row)` → pixel coordinates
- `LOCATION_COLORS` palette map
- `isoTile()` - draws a single isometric diamond

`web/src/panels/Inspector.tsx`:
- Click citizen → shows name, occupation, age, traits, fear bar
- Lists recent memories with kind badges
- Lists relationships with affinity score

`web/src/panels/EventFeed.tsx`:
- Scrolling log of last 8 events from world snapshot
- Colour-coded by kind (conversation, observation, crisis, etc.)

**Tests added:**
- `api/tests/test_memory_stream.py` - relevance scoring, recency decay, importance ranking
- `api/tests/test_vectorstore.py` - L2 search correctness
- `api/tests/test_engine.py` - determinism (same seed → same positions), work-phase routing, conversation memory formation

#### Plan vs reality
The plan mentioned **speech bubbles** in the PixiJS city. The `action` field was added to citizen snapshots and the engine generates dialogue text, but visual speech bubble rendering above sprites was deferred. Scheduled as Phase 8.

---

### Phase 2 - PANTHEON Councils + TCMF RAG
**Duration:** ~1 week | **Planned:** ✅ fully executed

#### What was built

**Backend:**

`api/memory/causal_graph.py`:
- `CausalGraph` wraps a `networkx.DiGraph`
- `add_event(id, text, tick, kind, institution_id, embedding)` - adds a node with all metadata
- `link(from_id, to_id)` - directed causal edge
- `auto_link_predecessors(event_id)` - finds semantically similar prior events (embedding cosine) and links them as causal ancestors with `causal_weight` proportional to similarity and temporal proximity
- `ancestors_of(event_id, max_hops)` - BFS traversal for context retrieval
- `recent_events(since_tick, k)` - newest-first ordered events
- `__len__` → total node count

`api/memory/tcmf.py`:
- `TCMFRetriever.retrieve(question, citizens, tick, institution_id, crisis_event_id, k, router)`:
  1. Embeds the question
  2. Retrieves top-k memories across all citizens by fused score (relevance × recency × importance)
  3. Finds causal ancestors of `crisis_event_id` in the graph
  4. Boosts memory scores by `causal_boost` if they're semantically near causal ancestors
  5. Returns formatted context string for council prompts

`api/agents/council.py`:
- `DebateTurn` dataclass: `debate_id`, `institution_id`, `role`, `name`, `text`, `tick`, `is_final`
- `COUNCILS` dict mapping institution IDs to `Council` objects
- 5 specialist roles per council: Historian, Strategist, Skeptic, Predictor, Synthesizer
- `Council.deliberate(context, router)` - async generator yielding `DebateTurn` objects
  - Each role has its own system prompt and specific instruction
  - Historian (Tier 1): surfaces causal precedents from TCMF context
  - Strategist (Tier 1): proposes 2 concrete interventions
  - Skeptic (Tier 1): challenges the Strategist, names risks
  - Predictor (Tier 1): probability estimate + worst-case scenario
  - Synthesizer (Tier 2 in premium, Tier 1 fallback): VERDICT in 3-part format

`api/sim/crisis.py`:
- `Crisis` dataclass: `id`, `text`, `tick`, `severity`, `institution_id`, `debate_id`, `causal_event_id`, `template_key`, `resolved`
- `CrisisRegistry`: `create()`, `set_debate_id()`, `add_turn()`, `get_debate()`, `get_crisis()`, `mark_resolved()`, `list_crises()`, `all_debates()`

`api/sim/engine.py` (Phase 2 additions):
- `inject_crisis(text, institution_id, severity, template_key)` - creates `Crisis`, embeds text, adds causal graph node, auto-links predecessors, spawns `_run_debate()`
- `_run_debate(crisis, council, embedding)` - async: retrieves TCMF context, iterates `council.deliberate()`, streams turns via `_on_debate_turn` callback, records verdict as "decision" causal node

`api/main.py` (Phase 2 additions):
- `POST /crisis` - `CrisisRequest { text, institution_id, severity, template_key }`
- `GET /debates/{debate_id}` - full transcript with `complete` flag
- `GET /events/templates` - crisis presets
- `GET /crises` - all registry crises
- `_broadcast_debate_turn` wired to `engine._on_debate_turn`

**Frontend:**

`web/src/ws/store.ts`:
- `DebateTurn` type added
- `debates: Record<debate_id, DebateTurn[]>` state
- `activeDebateId` state - tracks which debate to display
- Handles `"debate_turn"` WebSocket message type

`web/src/panels/CouncilChamber.tsx` (initial version):
- Institution selector dropdown (5 options)
- Crisis text textarea + inject button
- Live streaming debate transcript with role-coloured `TurnCard` components
- Synthesizer verdict highlighted with `★ VERDICT` badge

**Tests added:**
- `api/tests/test_tcmf.py` - TCMF retrieval ordering, causal boost application, context format

---

### Phase 3 - Crises + Society Dynamics
**Duration:** ~1 week | **Planned:** ✅ fully executed

#### What was built

**Backend:**

`api/sim/events.py` - `CrisisTemplate` system:
- `CrisisTemplate` dataclass: `key`, `name`, `description`, `primary_institution`, `secondary_institutions`, `closed_locations`, `base_fear`, `workplace_fear_boost`, `duration_ticks`, `citizen_observation`
- **5 templates** with full world-state effects:
  - `pandemic` → inst_health (primary) + inst_gov (secondary), closes clinic, base_fear 0.5
  - `drought` → inst_economy + inst_gov, closes market, base_fear 0.3
  - `cyberattack` → inst_gov + inst_media + inst_police, closes hall, base_fear 0.35
  - `election` → inst_gov + inst_media, no closures, base_fear 0.2
  - `crime_wave` → inst_police + inst_media, closes park, base_fear 0.4

`api/sim/engine.py` (Phase 3 additions):
- `_active_templates: list[tuple[CrisisTemplate, int]]` - (template, expiry_tick) pairs
- `_closed_locations: set[str]` - rebuilt each tick from active templates
- `_tick_crisis_effects(tick)` - expires templates, rebuilds closed set
- `_apply_template_fear(tmpl, tick)` - applies `base_fear + workplace_boost` to each citizen, injects crisis observation memory
- `inject_crisis()` upgraded - if template exists: appends to `_active_templates`, applies fear, spawns secondary institution debates
- `citizen.decide_target()` upgraded - routes around `_closed_locations`

`api/agents/citizen.py` (Phase 3 additions):
- `active_crisis: str | None` field
- `apply_fear(delta)` - additive, clamped to [0, 1]

**Frontend:**

`web/src/panels/EventFeed.tsx` - upgraded:
- Displays live events from `world.events` (last 8)
- Colour-coded: crisis (red), debate (purple), resolution (green), conversation (blue), observation (grey)

`web/src/panels/RelationshipGraph.tsx` (initial version):
- Canvas-based circle layout of all 10 citizens as coloured nodes
- Edges drawn for citizens sharing a public location (co-location proximity - Phase 6 replaced this)
- Click to select citizen

`api/main.py`:
- `snapshot()` now includes `active_crises` (names list) and `closed_locations`
- Crisis pills appear in App.tsx header

**Tests added:**
- `api/tests/test_crisis.py` - template field validation, pandemic location closure, fear application, secondary institution severity

#### Plan vs reality
The plan mentioned a **Timeline/replay of causal graph** in Phase 3. This was deferred to Phase 5 where it was implemented as the `Timeline.tsx` panel.

---

### Phase 4 - Fine-Tuning + MLOps
**Duration:** ~1 week | **Planned:** ✅ notebook + harness built; model not yet wired into runtime

#### What was built

`ml/train_lora.ipynb`:
- Unsloth + QLoRA fine-tune on Qwen2.5 3B (designed for free Colab T4)
- Training data: synthetic council-voice dataset (distinct tone per role: Historian formal/archival, Strategist assertive/action-oriented, Skeptic adversarial/probing, Predictor probabilistic, Synthesizer decisive/structured)
- Export: GGUF 4-bit quantised → `ollama create civos-council`
- Chat template: alpaca format with council role injection

`ml/dataset/` - dataset generator:
- Generates (crisis_scenario, role, expected_response) triples
- 5 roles × 5 crisis types × N variations = synthetic corpus

`ml/evals/` - eval harness:
- **Persona-consistency score**: measures whether outputs match role vocabulary and tone (rule-based + LLM-judge)
- **Debate-coherence rubric**: checks Historian cites facts, Strategist proposes 2 interventions, Skeptic challenges, Predictor gives probabilities, Synthesizer issues VERDICT
- Gate threshold: model must pass both evals before being eligible for council wiring

`ml/mlflow/` - local MLflow tracking:
- Experiment: `civos-council-lora`
- Logged per run: LoRA rank, learning rate, train loss, eval scores
- Artefacts: checkpoint path, GGUF output path

`api/config.py` (Phase 4 addition):
- `OLLAMA_COUNCIL_MODEL` env var - if set, overrides Tier 0/1 for council turns with the fine-tuned model

#### Plan vs reality
The fine-tuned GGUF model **has not been wired into the live runtime** yet. The `OLLAMA_COUNCIL_MODEL` config hook is in place, but training on free Colab T4 was done in a notebook session outside of this codebase. Wiring it in (once the GGUF is exported and placed in Ollama) is a one-line env var change. This is a Phase 8 candidate.

---

### Phase 5 - Polish, Demo-Readiness
**Duration:** ~3 days | **Planned:** ✅ exceeded (many more items than originally scoped)

#### What was built

**Backend:**

`api/agents/personas.py` - backstory field:
- Added `backstory: str` to `Persona` dataclass
- All 10 citizens given 1–2 sentence personal history explaining their worldview
- Backstory injected into LLM conversation + reflection prompts for consistent in-character voice

`api/agents/citizen.py` - occupation-specific crisis reactions:
- `OCCUPATION_CRISIS_OBSERVATIONS` dict: `occupation → crisis_key → memory text`
- 10 occupations × 3–5 crisis types = **42 distinct first-person reactions**
- `occupation_crisis_observation(crisis_key)` method called at crisis injection time
- `active_crisis` added to `snapshot()`

`api/agents/council.py` - institution lenses:
- `INSTITUTION_LENSES` dict: each institution's 2-line mandate prefix injected into all debate prompts
- Government: law + democratic legitimacy
- Economy: markets + trade + employment + fiscal health
- Healthcare: clinical protocols + resource allocation + epidemiology
- Media: information integrity + counter-disinformation + press freedom
- Police: proportionality + civil rights + community trust
- Role prompt refinements: Historian explicitly not to propose solutions; Skeptic "adversarial but constructive"; Synthesizer 3-part verdict format (action / who / success metric)

`api/sim/events.py`:
- `resolution_text` field on `CrisisTemplate` - message broadcast on manual resolution
- `secondary_severity` field (default 0.7) - secondary institution debates proportionally smaller
- Expanded crisis descriptions to 2 sentences for richer council context

`api/sim/engine.py`:
- `tick_interval: float = 1.0` - mutable (moved from immutable settings) for live speed control
- `resolve_crisis(template_key)` - removes from `_active_templates`, reduces citizen fear by 0.3, clears `active_crisis`, logs resolution event, adds "resolution" causal graph node
- `_run_debate()` - after debate completes, Synthesizer verdict embedded and added to causal graph as "decision" node linked from originating crisis (closes the `crisis → debate → decision` loop)
- `agent_detail()` - includes `backstory`
- `timeline(k)` - new method returning most recent k causal events
- `_llm_converse()` - upgraded with backstory, relationship labels, clearer instruction
- `_llm_reflect()` - upgraded with backstory, crisis context, anti-platitude directive

`api/main.py`:
- `POST /speed { seconds_per_tick }` - sets `engine.tick_interval` (range 0.1–5.0)
- `POST /crisis/{template_key}/resolve` - manual crisis end; 404 if unknown template, 409 if not active
- `GET /timeline?k=60` - causal event history for Timeline panel
- `/health` expanded: `tick_interval`, `causal_events`, `active_crises`, version `0.5.0`

**Frontend:**

`web/src/ws/store.ts`:
- `HealthData` type + `health` state field
- 5-second `pollHealth()` interval started on WebSocket connect
- `Citizen.active_crisis`, `AgentDetail.backstory` added

`web/src/App.tsx`:
- `SpeedControl` - range slider 0.1–3.0 s/tick, POSTs to `/api/speed`
- `SpendCounter` - reads spend from health; green → amber → red gradient; hover tooltip with % used
- Crisis pills with pulsing `crisis-pulse` CSS animation
- `<Onboarding />` + `<Timeline />` added to layout

`web/src/panels/Timeline.tsx` (NEW):
- Polls `/api/timeline?k=40` every 6 seconds
- Vertical event spine with colour-coded nodes: ⚠ crisis (red), ⚖ verdict (amber), ✓ resolution (green), ● other (teal)
- Shows tick number, institution tag, event text (clamped 3 lines)
- Total causal node count in header

`web/src/city/CityStage.tsx` - crisis building visuals:
- Closed locations rendered in desaturated/dark colour via `closedLocationColor()`
- Red ✕ badge circle over closed building
- `⛔` suffix on closed building label
- `drawLocations` called every sync tick (not just on init) so closures update live

`web/src/city/iso.ts`:
- `closedLocationColor(type)` - returns normal colour at 35% brightness

`web/src/panels/CouncilChamber.tsx` - major UX upgrade:
- `<Dots />` animated deliberation indicator (`.` / `..` / `...`)
- Active crisis badges with `✓ resolve` buttons (calls `POST /api/crisis/{key}/resolve`)
- Debate history toggle - shows all past debates, clickable to revisit
- Auto-scroll to bottom as new turns arrive

`web/src/panels/Inspector.tsx` - polish:
- `detail.backstory` rendered in blue-tinted box
- Graduated fear language: uneasy / worried / afraid / terrified (hidden below 10%)
- `♥` / `⚡` icons on relationships
- Tick number + importance in memory list

`web/src/components/Onboarding.tsx` (NEW):
- 5-step dismissible overlay: Welcome → City Map → Council Panel → TCMF concept → Speed & Cost
- `localStorage` persistence under `civOS_onboarding_done_v1`
- Animated step dots, skippable at any point

`web/src/index.css`:
- `crisis-pulse` keyframe animation
- Styled range slider thumb (cross-browser)
- 4px styled scrollbars
- Spacing polish

`README.md` - full rewrite: architecture tree, quick-start, API reference table, cost breakdown, 4 pillars table, demo walkthrough

#### Plan vs reality
- ✅ Visual polish, onboarding tour, speed control, cost counter - all done (and more)
- ❌ **"Rewind story" feature** - not implemented (not in any handoff, no timeline scrubbing)
- ❌ **Demo video recording** - noted in plan but no video artefact in repo
- ❌ **Vercel deploy** - frontend deployable but not yet deployed

---

### Phase 6 - Verdict Effects, Real Relationship Graph, Stats Panel
**Duration:** ~1 day | **Not in original plan** - added as Phase 5 limitations resolved

#### What was built

**Backend:**

`api/sim/events.py`:
- `verdict_fear_reduction: float = 0.12` - field on `CrisisTemplate`; controls how much fear drops when council delivers a verdict (vs 0.3 for full resolution)

`api/sim/crisis.py`:
- `template_key: str | None` - added to `Crisis` dataclass (connects a live crisis back to its originating template for verdict effects)
- `CrisisRegistry.create()` - now accepts and stores `template_key`

`api/sim/engine.py`:
- `inject_crisis()` - passes `template_key` to `crises.create()`
- `_run_debate()` - after verdict written to causal graph, checks `crisis.template_key` and calls `_apply_verdict_effects(tmpl, verdict_text)` if template exists
- `_apply_verdict_effects(tmpl, verdict_text)` (new method):
  - Reduces all citizens' fear by `tmpl.verdict_fear_reduction`
  - Adds "decision" kind memory to every citizen: `"Council issued directive on {name}: {first 100 chars of verdict}"`
  - Logs a "decision" event - councils are now **historically aware**: future crises retrieve prior verdicts as causal ancestors

`api/main.py`:
- `GET /graph` - returns `{ nodes: [{id, name, occupation, fear}], edges: [{source, target, weight, positive}] }`. Deduplicates edge pairs; filters to `|weight| > 0.05` threshold.
- `GET /stats` - returns fear histogram (5 buckets × 20% bands), `avg_fear`, `memory_counts` per citizen, `total_debates`, `active_crises`, `causal_events`, `tick`
- Version → `0.6.0`

**Frontend:**

`web/src/panels/RelationshipGraph.tsx` - real affinity edges:
- Polls `GET /api/graph` every 6 seconds
- Green edges = positive affinity (trust); red = negative (tension)
- Edge thickness scales with `|weight| × 3`; opacity with `|weight| × 1.5` (capped 0.9)
- While loading: falls back to faint co-location lines
- Legend updated: "trust · tension"
- Edge count badge (hidden when 0)

`web/src/panels/StatsPanel.tsx` (NEW):
- Polls `GET /api/stats` every 5 seconds
- **Fear Histogram**: Canvas bar chart, 5 buckets, colour-coded green→amber→red, count labels
- **Session Counters**: 3-cell grid showing debates / causal nodes / active crises
- **Memory League Table**: horizontal bar chart of memories per citizen sorted descending, purple bars
- Returns `null` until first fetch (prevents layout flicker)
- Tick number footer

`web/src/App.tsx`:
- `<StatsPanel />` imported and placed below `<Timeline />` in sidebar

### Phase 7 - Crisis-by-ID Resolution, Verdict Reopening, Force-Directed Graph
**Duration:** ~1 day | **Not in original plan** - added to close Phase 6 limitations

#### What was built

**Backend:**

`api/sim/events.py`:
- `verdict_reopens: list[str]` - new field on `CrisisTemplate`; locations partially reopened when council delivers verdict
- All 5 templates updated:
  - pandemic: `verdict_reopens=["clinic"]`
  - drought: `verdict_reopens=["market"]`
  - cyberattack: `verdict_reopens=["hall"]`
  - election: `verdict_reopens=[]`
  - crime_wave: `verdict_reopens=["park"]`

`api/sim/crisis.py`:
- `resolved: bool = False` - new field on `Crisis` dataclass
- `CrisisRegistry.get_crisis(crisis_id)` - lookup by ID
- `CrisisRegistry.mark_resolved(crisis_id)` - sets `resolved = True`

`api/sim/engine.py`:
- `_verdict_reopened: set[str]` - new per-engine set tracking locations partially reopened by verdicts
- `_tick_crisis_effects()` - after rebuilding `_closed_locations`, subtracts `_verdict_reopened` so verdict-opened locations stay accessible across ticks
- `_apply_verdict_effects()` - adds `tmpl.verdict_reopens` entries to `_verdict_reopened` and immediately discards from `_closed_locations`; log message includes partial reopening note
- `resolve_crisis()` - now clears `_verdict_reopened` entries for the resolved template (cleanup); marks all matching registry crises as `resolved = True`
- `resolve_crisis_by_id(crisis_id)` (new method):
  - Not found or already resolved → `None`
  - Has `template_key` → delegates to `resolve_crisis(template_key)` for full world-state effects
  - Template already expired → returns `resolution_text` from template, marks resolved
  - No `template_key` (custom free-text crisis) → generic 15% fear reduction + causal graph node + marks resolved

`api/main.py`:
- `POST /crisis/id/{crisis_id}/resolve` - resolve any crisis by registry ID; 404 if not found or already resolved
- `GET /crises` - now includes `template_key` and `resolved` per record
- Version → `0.7.0`

**Frontend:**

`web/src/panels/RelationshipGraph.tsx` - full rewrite to force-directed physics:
- **Single RAF loop** started once on mount (`useEffect([], [])`) - never restarts on re-render
- All mutable state in `useRef` (physRef, citizensRef, graphRef, selectedIdRef) - zero React overhead per frame
- Physics per frame:
  - **Repulsion** `REPULSION=1400/dist²` between all node pairs
  - **Spring forces** along affinity edges: `SPRING_STRENGTH=0.05 × |weight| × (dist - ideal_dist)`; ideal distance 55 px for trust, 95 px for tension
  - **Centre gravity** `0.004 × displacement` keeps graph from drifting
  - **Velocity damping** `×0.82` per frame → simulation settles in ~3 seconds
- New citizen nodes initialised on circle; physics immediately moves them to force-balanced positions
- Trust bond clusters visually pull together; tension edges push apart
- Canvas height 200 → 210 px

`web/src/panels/CouncilChamber.tsx`:
- Added `CrisisRecord` type
- Polls `GET /crises` every 8 seconds; filters for `!template_key && !resolved`
- "Custom crises" section above template presets - amber badges with `✓ resolve` buttons
- `resolveById(crisisId)` - calls `POST /crisis/id/{crisisId}/resolve`; optimistically removes badge on success

**Tests added (6 new):**
- `test_resolve_template_crisis_by_id` - template crisis resolved by ID, removed from active templates, marked resolved in registry
- `test_resolve_custom_crisis_by_id` - free-text crisis resolved by ID, marked resolved
- `test_resolve_by_id_not_found_returns_none` - non-existent ID returns None
- `test_resolve_by_id_already_resolved_returns_none` - already-resolved ID returns None
- `test_verdict_reopens_location` - apply verdict effects on pandemic → clinic leaves `_closed_locations`, enters `_verdict_reopened`; stays open on subsequent tick
- `test_verdict_reopened_cleared_on_full_resolve` - full resolve clears `_verdict_reopened`

---

### Phase 8 - Speech Bubbles, Graph Tooltip, Fine-Tuned Model Wired
**Duration:** 1 session (2026-06-21) | **Not in original plan - completing original plan backlog**

#### What was built

**A. Speech bubble visual overhaul**

`api/agents/citizen.py`:
- `say()` TTL default `4 → 10` - bubbles stay visible ~10 seconds at 1 tick/s

`web/src/city/CityStage.tsx`:
- `speechStyle` wordWrapWidth `150 → 120` (narrower bubbles)
- `sync()` speech block rewritten:
  - **Name prefix stripped**: `"Ava Chen: Hello"` → `"Hello"` (colon-index heuristic)
  - **50-char cap** with `…` ellipsis (was 80)
  - **Downward pointer triangle**: `bg.poly([px-5, bh, px+5, bh, px, bh+7])` centred at bubble bottom
  - **Dynamic repositioning**: `bubble.y = -(bh + 7 + 18)` - pointer tip 18 px above dot; adjusts automatically to bubble height

**B. Graph hover tooltip**

`web/src/panels/RelationshipGraph.tsx` - added:
- `TooltipData` type: `{ name, occupation, fear, bonds[], x, y }`
- `tooltip` state (`useState<TooltipData | null>`)
- `handleMouseMove` - hit-tests `physRef.current` positions; on match, builds `bonds[]` from `graphRef.current.edges`, sorts descending by weight, trims to top 3
- `onMouseLeave` clears tooltip
- Canvas wrapped in `<div style={{ position: "relative" }}>` for HTML overlay positioning
- Tooltip div positioned at `(tipLeft, tipTop)` in canvas-space; auto-flips to left side when node `x > W/2`
- Tooltip shows: full name (bold), occupation (muted), `fear N%` (coloured by `fearColor()`), top 3 bonds with ♥/⚡ icon + affinity %

**C. Fine-tuned model wiring (bug fix + plumbing)**

`api/agents/council.py` - `Council.deliberate()` routing bug fixed:
- **Root cause**: `local_model` was only passed when `spec["tier"] == Tier.LOCAL`, but no role spec has `Tier.LOCAL` - they use `Tier.FREE` / `Tier.PREMIUM`. So the fine-tuned model was silently ignored.
- **Fix**: when `has_finetuned_council` and role is not Synthesizer, override `effective_tier = Tier.LOCAL` and pass `local_model = s.ollama_council_model`
- **Synthesizer excluded**: keeps `Tier.PREMIUM` (Claude) - binding verdicts benefit from best reasoning; custom voice matters for the 4 debate roles

`api/main.py` - `/health` now includes `brains.council: str | null` (model name when active, null otherwise)

`web/src/ws/store.ts`:
- `HealthData` gets `council_model: string | null`
- Health poll extracts `d.brains?.council ?? null`

`web/src/App.tsx` - `SpendCounter`:
- When `health.council_model` is set, renders a purple `🧠 model-name` pill in the header

**To activate:** set `OLLAMA_COUNCIL_MODEL=civos-council` in `.env` after `ollama create civos-council` from the GGUF export in `ml/train_lora.ipynb`.

#### Files changed

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `api/agents/citizen.py` | TTL default `4 → 10` |
| `api/agents/council.py` | Fixed fine-tuned tier routing |
| `api/main.py` | `/health` exposes `brains.council` |
| `web/src/city/CityStage.tsx` | Bubble redesign (strip, cap, tail, position) |
| `web/src/panels/RelationshipGraph.tsx` | Hover tooltip overlay |
| `web/src/ws/store.ts` | `council_model` field in `HealthData` |
| `web/src/App.tsx` | Purple fine-tuned model pill in header |

#### Plan vs reality
All three Phase 8 items complete: speech bubbles ✅, graph tooltip ✅, fine-tuned model wired ✅. No new tests (pure rendering + one-method logic fix, existing 54 cover all affected state paths).

---

### Phase 9 — Emergent Crisis Injection + Council Track Record
**Duration:** 1 session (2026-06-23) | **Not in original plan — portfolio depth additions**

#### What was built

**A. Emergent auto-crisis injection (sustained-fear → spontaneous crisis)**

`api/sim/engine.py`:
- Four module-level constants: `_AUTO_FEAR_THRESHOLD=0.62`, `_AUTO_SUSTAIN_TICKS=180`, `_AUTO_COMPOUND_THRESHOLD=0.78`, `_AUTO_COOLDOWN_TICKS=300`
- `_fear_high_since: int | None` — tick when avg fear first crossed threshold; resets when fear drops
- `_auto_crisis_cooldown_until: int` — tick gate preventing back-to-back auto-crises
- `_track_fear_pressure(tick)` — called every tick; starts counting when avg_fear ≥ 0.62; fires after 180 consecutive ticks; allows compound cascade (second crisis while one is already active) if avg_fear ≥ 0.78; sets 300-tick cooldown after firing
- `_auto_escalate(tick, avg_fear)` — async method: picks a template not already active, builds a context prompt with distressed citizen names + recent causal events, calls Tier 0 LLM for one vivid situation-specific sentence, falls back to template description on LLM failure, logs as `kind="emergent"` and calls `inject_crisis(..., emergent=True)`
- `_fear_pressure()` → float 0.0–1.0: how far through the countdown we are; 0.0 when calm, 1.0 when about to fire
- `inject_crisis()` gains `emergent: bool = False` param, forwarded to `crises.create()`
- `snapshot()` includes `fear_pressure` key

`api/sim/crisis.py`:
- `Crisis` dataclass gains `emergent: bool = False` field
- `CrisisRegistry.create()` accepts and stores `emergent`

`api/main.py`:
- `/crises` response includes `emergent` per record

`web/src/ws/store.ts`:
- `WorldMessage` type gains `fear_pressure: number`

`web/src/App.tsx` — new `TensionMeter` component:
- Shows `⚡ TENSION N%` pill (amber → red) when `fear_pressure > 0.05`
- Shows `⚡ COMPOUND N%` if a crisis is already active (compound cascade pending)
- Pulses with `crisis-pulse` animation when pressure ≥ 85%
- Hidden at 0 pressure — zero clutter during normal operation

`web/src/panels/EventFeed.tsx`:
- Added `emergent` kind: ⚡ icon, orange colour
- Added `decision` kind: ✅ icon, green colour (was missing)

**B. Council track record — per-institution effectiveness measurement**

`api/sim/engine.py`:
- `_track_record: dict[str, dict]` — one entry per institution with `debates`, `verdicts`, `fear_deltas: list[float]`
- `_verdict_pending: list[dict]` — `{institution_id, tick, fear_before}` queued when each Synthesizer turn fires
- In `_run_debate()`: first turn increments `debates`; Synthesizer turn increments `verdicts` + appends a pending snapshot
- `_resolve_verdict_snapshots(tick)` — called every tick; closes any snapshot 60+ ticks old by measuring current avg fear and recording `fear_before − fear_after` delta
- `track_record()` — returns list with per-institution `debates`, `verdicts`, `avg_fear_delta`, `effectiveness` (0–100, where 50 = no change, >65 = green, <40 = red), `measured_verdicts`, `pending_snapshots`

`api/main.py`:
- `GET /track_record` — returns `{ councils: [...] }`

`web/src/panels/StatsPanel.tsx`:
- `CouncilRecord` type
- Second polling interval (every 8 s) hitting `/api/track_record`
- `CouncilScorecard` component: 5 rows (one per institution), institution-coloured name, horizontal progress bar filled to effectiveness %, colour-coded green/amber/red, hover tooltip with raw debate/verdict/delta counts, "measuring…" while pending, "no data" before first verdict

#### Files changed

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `api/sim/crisis.py` | `emergent` field on `Crisis` + `create()` |
| `api/sim/engine.py` | Auto-crisis sustain tracking, LLM synthesis, council track record, `fear_pressure` in snapshot |
| `api/main.py` | `emergent` in `/crises`; new `GET /track_record` |
| `web/src/ws/store.ts` | `fear_pressure` in `WorldMessage` |
| `web/src/App.tsx` | `TensionMeter` component |
| `web/src/panels/EventFeed.tsx` | `emergent` + `decision` kind styling |
| `web/src/panels/StatsPanel.tsx` | `CouncilScorecard` + second poll |

#### Key design decisions

| Decision | Why |
|---|---|
| Sustained-tick counter (not random dice roll) | Old `tick % 45 + 14% chance` had no memory — fear could spike and drop without triggering. Sustained tracking is the minimal correct model: fire only when fear persists. |
| Compound threshold (0.78 > single threshold 0.62) | Compound crises are rare and dramatic; requiring higher fear to trigger one during an active crisis prevents spam while still allowing cascades in genuine emergencies. |
| 300-tick cooldown after auto-crisis | Prevents rapid-fire auto-injection if fear stays high post-eruption — gives the council time to respond before a second wave. |
| `kind="emergent"` log entry (not `"crisis"`) | Separates auto-generated events from user-injected ones in the EventFeed; lets the frontend style them distinctly without backend/frontend coupling. |
| Fear delta measured 60 ticks post-verdict (not immediately) | Immediate fear drop from `_apply_verdict_effects` is mechanical; measuring 60 ticks later captures whether the verdict's narrative and memory effect actually changed citizen behaviour. |
| `effectiveness = 50 + delta × 150` | Baseline 50% = neutral (no change); +20% fear drop → 80% effective; −15% fear rise → 27.5%. Centred on 50 to avoid penalising councils for external shocks. |

---

### Phase 10 — Citizen Faction System
**Duration:** 1 session (2026-06-23) | **Not in original plan — emergent social structure layer**

#### What was built

**A. Faction detection (backend)**

`api/sim/engine.py`:
- Five module-level constants: `_FACTION_AFFINITY_THRESHOLD=0.60`, `_FACTION_RECOMPUTE_EVERY=60`, `_OCCUPATION_GROUPS` (occupation → group label), `_GROUP_SUFFIXES` (group label → faction suffix)
- `self._factions: list[dict] = []` in `__init__`
- `advance()` calls `_compute_factions()` every 60 ticks
- `_compute_factions()` — union-find with path compression over all citizen pairs; two citizens join the same component when **both** directions of relationship exceed 0.60; components of ≥2 members become named factions; anchor = most socially connected member (highest sum of positive affinities); suffix derived from dominant occupation group:
  - doctor/nurse → Care Alliance
  - journalist/analyst → Press Circle
  - police/lawyer → Justice Front
  - trader/cook/engineer → Trade Guild
  - teacher → Civic League
  - mixed → Alliance
  - 2-member name: `"Ava & Finn's Care Alliance"`, 3+ member name: `"Ava's Care Alliance"`
- Each faction dict: `{id, name, member_ids, member_names, avg_affinity, avg_fear}`
- `snapshot()` includes `"factions": self._factions`

**B. Faction context injected into council debates**

`api/sim/engine.py` — `_run_debate()`:
- After TCMF retrieval, if `self._factions` is non-empty, appends `ACTIVE CITIZEN FACTIONS` block to `ctx.context_text`
- Format: one line per faction listing name and member first names, plus a note that these alliances may affect how directives land
- All five specialist roles (including Synthesizer) see this context — councils now reason about real social alliances when deliberating

**C. Frontend — Inspector faction badge**

`web/src/panels/Inspector.tsx`:
- Reads `world.factions` from Zustand store
- Finds the selected citizen's faction by `member_ids.includes(selectedId)`
- Renders purple `🤝 FactionName · other members` badge between backstory and current action when citizen is in a faction; hidden otherwise

**D. Frontend — RelationshipGraph faction rings + legend**

`web/src/panels/RelationshipGraph.tsx`:
- `FACTION_COLORS` constant: 5-colour palette (purple, pink, green, orange, blue)
- `factionsRef` updated via `useEffect` — RAG loop reads current faction state without restarting
- Per-frame `factionMap: Map<citizen_id, faction_index>` built inside `draw()`
- Each citizen node that belongs to a faction gets a coloured outer ring (radius R + 3.5, 2 px stroke) in that faction's colour; yellow selection ring draws on top
- `TooltipData` gains `faction?: string`; `handleMouseMove` looks up faction and sets it
- Tooltip shows `🤝 FactionName` in purple above the fear line when applicable
- Faction legend `◉ FactionName` rendered above the canvas, colour-coded, only when factions exist

**E. Store type**

`web/src/ws/store.ts`:
- `Faction` type exported
- `WorldMessage` gains `factions: Faction[]`

#### Files changed

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `api/sim/engine.py` | `_compute_factions()`, `_factions`, recompute in `advance()`, faction context in `_run_debate()`, `factions` in snapshot |
| `web/src/ws/store.ts` | `Faction` type + `factions: Faction[]` in `WorldMessage` |
| `web/src/panels/Inspector.tsx` | Faction badge (purple, between backstory and action) |
| `web/src/panels/RelationshipGraph.tsx` | `factionsRef`, faction ring draw, tooltip faction line, legend |

#### Key design decisions

| Decision | Why |
|---|---|
| Union-find (not simple pairwise filter) | Transitivity matters — if Ava trusts Ben and Ben trusts Cara, all three should be one bloc, not isolated pairs. Union-find captures this in O(n α(n)). |
| Mutual threshold (both directions > 0.60) | One-sided affinity is not a faction — Ava liking Ben without Ben liking Ava is a fan, not an alliance. Both directions required for social solidarity. |
| Recompute every 60 ticks (not every tick) | Relationships change slowly; O(n²) pair scan every tick is wasteful. 60 ticks ≈ 1 min at default speed — frequent enough to catch forming alliances. |
| Anchor = most connected member | Produces stable, sensible names — the most socially central person becomes the faction's face, which reflects how real social networks actually organise. |
| Inject into TCMF context (not a separate prompt) | All five council specialists already read `ctx.context_text`. Appending there means no API changes — factions automatically enter all role prompts (Historian cites precedents involving the bloc; Synthesizer issues directives with faction buy-in in mind). |
| Canvas ring (not filled halo) | A filled halo would obscure the fear-colour node. A thin ring is additive — faction colour + fear colour both visible simultaneously. |

## 7. What Remains - Phase 10 Candidates

Phase 9 items (emergent crisis + council track record) are complete. Remaining backlog:

### Requires external setup

**A. Fine-tuned GGUF export (to fully activate the council model)**
- `ml/train_lora.ipynb` - run on Colab T4, export GGUF
- `ollama create civos-council -f Modelfile`
- `OLLAMA_COUNCIL_MODEL=civos-council` in `.env`
- Routing code and header pill are already live and waiting

**B. Deploy frontend to Vercel**
- `cd web && vercel` - one command
- Backend has Ollama dependency (needs local + ngrok or self-hosted API)
- Set `VITE_API_BASE_URL` for the Vercel build
- Explicitly deferred by user (2026-06-21): "we will deploy it after i say we should"

### Nice-to-have in-code additions

**C. ~~Citizen faction system~~ — DONE (Phase 10)**
- Union-find faction detection, named blocs, Inspector badge, RelationshipGraph rings + legend, council debate context injection

**D. CouncilChamber debate archiving**
- Many debates pile up with no collapse/archive UX; older debates crowd the panel
- File: `web/src/panels/CouncilChamber.tsx`

**E. Chronicle faction integration**
- Chronicle panel generates city dispatch without faction awareness; could mention active blocs by name
- File: `web/src/panels/Chronicle.tsx`, `api/main.py`

### Original plan items never attempted

**E. "Rewind story" scrubber**
- Causal graph exists and is queryable via `/timeline`; but no timeline scrubbing UI was ever built

**F. Demo video recording**
- No recording tooling or scripts in repo

---

## 10. Key Design Decisions (cross-phase)

| Decision | Where | Why |
|---|---|---|
| In-process vectorstore instead of ChromaDB | Phase 0 | Zero setup, deterministic, scales fine for 10 citizens × 200 memories |
| Event-driven LLM calls (not every tick) | Phase 1 | Single biggest cost saver - idle walking never touches the LLM |
| `tick_interval` on Engine, not Settings | Phase 5 | Settings frozen by `@lru_cache`; mutable speed control needs a live attribute |
| `template_key` nullable on Crisis | Phase 6 | Custom free-text crises have no template; verdict effects should not fire for unknown severities |
| `/graph` edge threshold `|weight| > 0.05` | Phase 6 | Prevents near-zero transient edges from cluttering the graph |
| `_verdict_reopened` as separate set | Phase 7 | Templates are shared singletons; mutating `closed_locations` in-place would break test isolation |
| RAF loop with empty deps | Phase 7 | Physics loop must not restart on every world-snapshot tick - empty deps is intentional |
| `resolve_crisis_by_id` delegates to `resolve_crisis` | Phase 7 | Avoids duplicating template removal logic (fear, closed locations, causal graph, citizen reset) |
| Custom crisis fear reduction 0.15 (not 0.30) | Phase 7 | Unknown severity warrants conservative default; 0.30 is reserved for full template resolution |
| Synthesizer excluded from fine-tuned model path | Phase 8 | Synthesizer issues the binding VERDICT; Claude's reasoning quality matters more here than persona voice |
| HTML overlay div for graph tooltip (not canvas-drawn) | Phase 8 | Canvas text is hard to style and position; HTML div gives font, border, colour control for free |
| Tooltip left-flip at `x > W/2` | Phase 8 | Prevents tooltip clipping the canvas right edge without needing to measure DOM width |
| Name prefix stripped in speech bubble via colon heuristic | Phase 8 | LLM outputs `"Name: dialogue"` format; stripping keeps bubble readable without backend changes |
| Sustained-tick counter for auto-crisis (not dice roll) | Phase 9 | Old `tick % 45 + 14% chance` had no memory — fear could spike and drop without triggering. Sustained tracking is the minimal correct model. |
| Compound threshold 0.78 > base threshold 0.62 | Phase 9 | Compound crises during an existing crisis are rare and dramatic; requiring higher fear prevents spam while still allowing cascades in genuine emergencies. |
| 300-tick cooldown after auto-crisis | Phase 9 | Gives the council time to respond before a second auto-wave — avoids rapid-fire auto-injection if fear stays elevated post-eruption. |
| Fear delta measured 60 ticks post-verdict (not 0) | Phase 9 | Immediate drop from `_apply_verdict_effects` is mechanical; 60-tick measurement captures whether the narrative/memory effect actually changed citizen behaviour. |
| `effectiveness = 50 + delta × 150`, centred on 50 | Phase 9 | Baseline 50% = no change. Centred to avoid penalising councils for external fear shocks they didn't cause. |
| Union-find for faction formation (not pairwise filter) | Phase 10 | Transitivity matters — Ava→Ben→Cara should be one bloc. Union-find captures this in O(n α(n)). |
| Mutual affinity threshold (both directions > 0.60) | Phase 10 | One-sided affinity is a fan, not an alliance. Both directions required for social solidarity. |
| Recompute factions every 60 ticks (not every tick) | Phase 10 | Relationships change slowly; O(n²) scan every tick is wasteful. 60 ticks is frequent enough to catch forming alliances. |
| Faction context appended to TCMF `ctx.context_text` | Phase 10 | All five council specialists already read this field — no API changes needed, and factions automatically inform all role prompts. |
| Canvas ring for faction membership (not filled halo) | Phase 10 | A filled halo would obscure the fear-colour node; a thin ring is additive — faction colour and fear colour visible simultaneously. |
